Spectral clustering:

K-Means Clustering Algorithm process:
1. specify desired number of clusters
2. Randomly assign each data point to cluster
3. Computer cluster centroids
4. Reassign each point to the closest cluster centroid
5. Recomputer cluster centroids
6. Repeat 4 and 5 until no improvement is made

Random Forest techniques works better with K-Means Clustering than no Clustering

Analysis:
Look for specific characteristics  within each cluster
Look for specific trends within each cluster RELEVANT TO TARGET
It's like looking at different "types/clusters" of scenarios as predictors for target
